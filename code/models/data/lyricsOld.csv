0,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey, your soul
It could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are",2015

2,"I'm hurting, babe, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving, I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You've got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees

I don't want to be needing your love
I just want to be deep in your love
And still in me when you're away
Ooh baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are
I just want to be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

3,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sins
Saw you there and I thought

""Oh my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (mmm)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
It'll leave you breathless (mmm)

Convinced we were broken inside, inside

5,"Your man on the road, he doing promo
You said keep our business on the low-low

'Cause you look even better than the photos

I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five

And you gon' have to do it at my tempo

Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs start to feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Hide your lies, girl hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

7,"And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young

8,"You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites

Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire

9,"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

It's too hard to sleep

Nothing on me

12,"Like a small boat
In the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion

Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm all right song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)

And it's been two years, I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
And I still believe
Yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm all right song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
In the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion

Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm all right song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Now I've still got a lot of fight left in me",1990

When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, mmm
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed

Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street

About myself, I'm sorry

Where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

Ya feel me?

First, let me hop out motherfucking Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be balling on these niggas, got me feeling like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort

Had too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit
Ground by the toilet
I'm just barley getting started

You already upset
Got a tiger as a pet
I just took 'em to the vet
Homie I been making hits
I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me
Like she was on a feeder

If the pussy ain't good
Then I prolly won't feed her
Lil' homie, you can keep her
Because I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout a feature

Homeboy, you's a pee on
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you getting peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set just in case they wanna sleep on
Ya dig...

I'm a full time playa
Hopping out of alligators
Sipping lean and now a later
Homie, I'll annihilate you
If you think you wanna battle
You gone have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her
I will never ever date her

It's a shame how I'm barely getting love in this city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fucking with me
I be killin' this shit
Pray to God they forgive me
They say when you blow up, don't forget me
Man...

I been on fire
Ever since they made the lighter
My boys a pull up on yo' homie, I ain't talking diapers
Walk into your function on point; I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her

Flexing all on ya other homeboys, you ain't ready
10 times sharper than Michael Myer's machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody saying ""Who is Rickey Wayne?""
That's me",2000

Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus

Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright",2015

You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
You're in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors till the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon tee shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town like they're in your living-room

Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors till the whole block hates us

Come on.

All week long it's a farming town they're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road
They take one last lap around,
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where there ain't nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out,
Baby, watch your step now,
Better have your boots on.

Kick the dust up,
Back it on up,
Fill your cup up,
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up.

Bar downtown, they got a line of people waiting out the door.
10 dollar drinks, it's packed inside, I don't know what they're waiting for.
Got me a jar full of 'Clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it's like knock knock knock goes the diesel,
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where there ain't nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out,
Baby, watch your step now,
Better have your boots on.

Kick the dust up,
Let's back it on up,
Fill your cup up,
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up.

Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge you all gonna be glad you did.
Kick it.

We go way out where there ain't nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party.
Pedal to the floorboard
End up in a four door
Burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out,
Baby, watch your step now.
Better have your boots on,

Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up,
That's what's up up,
Let's kick the dust up",2015

One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink

Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb

Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long (all night long)

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would've had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a lifetime

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh, up up all night long

Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time
One more time

47,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love

Don't fuck with my love

48,"I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you, it keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through

These guys sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you, it keeps me awake

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you, it keeps me awake

Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living in the sin

Boy, you never told me
True love was going to hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you, it keeps me awake

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you, it keeps me awake

Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting baby

I keep going to the river

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you, it keeps me awake

I keep going to the river to pray

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here (oh oh, oh oh)",2015

Changes into something red
