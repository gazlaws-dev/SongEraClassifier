0,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey, your soul
It could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are",2015

I'm like ""hey, what's up, hello""
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 50, 60 grand, 5 100 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go

And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cooking pies with my baby, yeah

I be in the kitchen cooking pies with my baby, yeah

I hit the strip with my trap queen 'cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a 'Lamb
I might just snatch her necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't want it for nothin' because I got her everything
Bitch you up in the bando, without deniro can't go
Remi boys got extendo, count up hella bands tho
How far can your Benz go?

2,"I'm hurting, babe, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving, I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You've got me begging, begging, I'm on my knees

I don't want to be needing your love
I just want to be deep in your love
And still in me when you're away
Ooh baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are
I just want to be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
A little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

My broken pieces, you picked them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging, come give me some
When I'm without you, oh, so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

I don't want to be needing your love
I just want to be deep in your love
And still in me when you're away
Ooh baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are
I just want to be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here 'cause I need
A little love, a little sympathy

Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California day
I don't want to play no games, you don't got to be afraid
Don't give me all that shine shit, no makeup on, that's my

Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
