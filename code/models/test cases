Yo, VIP, let's kick it!\nIce ice baby\nIce ice baby\nAll right stop\nCollaborate and listen\nIce is back with my brand new invention\nSomething grabs a hold of me tightly\nThen I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly\nWill it ever stop?\nYo, I don't know\nTurn off the lights and I'll glow\nTo the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal\nLight up a stage and wax a chump like a candle\nDance\nBum rush the speaker that booms\nI'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom\nDeadly, when I play a dope melody\nAnything less that the best is a felony\nLove it or leave it\nYou better gain way\nYou better hit bull's eye\nThe kid don't play\nIf there was a problem\nYo, I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\nIce ice baby Vanilla\nIce ice baby Vanilla\nIce ice baby Vanilla\nIce ice baby Vanilla

You would not believe your eyes\nIf ten million fireflies\nLit up the world as I fell asleep\n'Cause they fill the open air\nAnd leave teardrops everywhere\nYou'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare\nI'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly\nIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\n'Cause everything is never as it seems\n'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs\nFrom ten thousand lightning bugs\nAs they tried to teach me how to dance\nA foxtrot above my head\nA sock hop beneath my bed\nA disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)\nI'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly\nIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\n'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)\nLeave my door open just a crack\nPlease take me away from here\n'Cause I feel like such an insomniac\nPlease take me away from here\nWhy do I tire of counting sheep\nPlease take me away from here\nWhen I'm far too tired to fall asleep

Risin' up, back on the street\nDid my time, took my chances\nWent the distance, now I'm back on my feet\nJust a man and his will to survive\nSo many times, it happens too fast\nYou trade your passion for glory\nDon't lose your grip on the dreams of the past\nYou must fight just to keep them alive\nIt's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight\nRisin' up to the challenge of our rival\nAnd the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night\nAnd he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger\nFace to face, out in the heat\nHangin' tough, stayin' hungry\nThey stack the odds 'till we take to the street\nFor the kill with the skill to survive

Up in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' V-I, but keep it down on the low key (low key), 'cause you know how it feels.\nI saw shorty she was checkin' up on me, from the game she was spittin' in my ear you would think that she knew me.\nSo we decided to chill\n\nConversation got heavy, she had me feelin' like she's ready to blow!\n(Watch out! Oh! Watch out!)\nShe's saying, "Come get me! Come get me."\nSo I got up and followed her to the floor, she said, "Baby, let's go."\nThat's when I told her I said\n\nYeah (yeah), shorty got down low and said come and get me\nYeah (yeah), I got so caught up I forgot she told me\nYeah (yeah), her and my girl used to be the best of homies\nYeah (yeah), next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming:\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah!\nYeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah\nSo she's all up in my head now, got me thinking that it might be a good idea to take her with me,\n'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave)\nBut I gotta keep it real now, 'cause on a one to ten she's a certified twenty, but that just ain't me.
